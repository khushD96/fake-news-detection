# fake-news-detection
Recent information emerging on a social networking site is questionable and in many situations it misleads other network users. Fake news is purposefully disseminated in order to mislead readers into believing fake stories making it harder for detection mechanisms to detect fake news based on shared material. As a result, need to include some additional information about the user’s profile such as the user’s engagement with others in making a choice. The distributed information and its dissemination process pose a significant challenge in recognising these contents quickly and emphasising the necessity for automatic fake news detecting. Fake news can undoubtedly be resolved with the use of artificial intelligence, which includes machine learning algorithms. The goal of this project is to propose a Logistic Regression based fake news detection model, to assess the effectiveness of Logistic Regression as a fake news detection model and to create a web application. Logistic Regression was used to detect fake news. According to past studies Logistic Regression performed well in categorization tasks. I will start working on n this project from this week and follow agile development practices. I intend to complete this project by end of next 4 weeks.
